# Visual Inspection of Motorcycle Connecting Rods
This project was undertaken for the Computer Vision course within the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna. The objective was to analyze images containing motorcycle rods to extract features such as length, orientation, and inclination angle. Some images included noise (depicted as black points) or instances of touching objects. Hence, techniques were applied to clean these images and separate the elements prior to extracting the desired features.
